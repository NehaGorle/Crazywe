            <h3>Kutti story😅 </h3>
            <p>Our journey was the most unexpected thing<br>...I never thought this would last this long and now I can't even imagine <br> my live without these two idiots.</p>
            <h4>Our first yearrr</h4>...<p>I was totally clueless about the city and college .....<br>It was the first day I met these people and the rest is history ....<br>Our first year was dedicated to books and it was lame ...<br>little did we know that pandemic is comming we would have enjoyed little more...<br>but first year was fun with books and new life  </p>
            <h4>Comming to our second year </h4>...<p>we became seniors ...<br>we learned to bunk classes and enjoy in our college but it lasted for few days <br>as our uninvided guest(CORONA) came and stuck with us for two years sadly but the<br> frustating part is our guest would leave the country when we have exams ..<br>no idea why</p>
            <h4>And the third year </h4>...<p>for us this year was like only for exams....we were fed up with our college and those unnecessary exams ....<br>But our friendship  grew a long way in these two years ....<br>our calls lasted for hours ...and we used to talk daily ...<br>even now I wonder what shit we use to talk for those many hours...</p>and
             <br> <p>"oh"</p> <h4>It's our final year</h4>....<p>we dreamt of many thing like trips,nightouts,class party,convocations...etc.....<br>but out of our luck we did nothing literally nothing....<br>not even one...<br>but we enjoyed a lot in our project ....<br>it was a rollarcoaster ride  </p>
            <p>I didn't even realise our bond is so thick until I left our college ....<br>unknowingly my eyes used to fill with water thinking about these two girls<br> Okay not going to the emotional part</p>
